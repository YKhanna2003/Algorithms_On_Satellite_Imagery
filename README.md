# Algorithms_On_Satellite_Imagery
Algorithm Application on Satellite Imagery, demonstrating Data Analysis and Algorithm fine-tuning

Project Status: Ongoing, can expect more commits soon. Feel free to use the repository for your development, try to integrate your own API key instead of using mine as the program might break if the API key expires.

Folder 1: Obtain the satellite imagery from the given latitude and longitude based on BING Maps API.

Folder 2: Obatin the imagery for a overall region and break the image into smaller images of specified dimensions.
